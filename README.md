The purpose of this course is to incorporate digital humanities methods (Data Visualization, Text Mining and Natural Language Processing) into history research for PhD students. 

However, I was an undergraduate student, and decided not to pursue further historical research. Therefore, I tried to applied what I learned to a small project. The result is this 25 page paper.

I started with the idea of doing text mining on the early 20th century Japanese Literature, but realized that would be too much for a paper of this length. Therefor after a brief historiographical introduction, I focused on text mining on works of [Natsume Soseki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natsume_S%C5%8Dseki) and especially his [*Kokoro*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kokoro)
